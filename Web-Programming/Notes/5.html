DEFINITIONS:

  - Document Object Model (DOM): An interface that represents how HTML documents
    are read by the browser.
    -- It organizes an HTML document as an object that can be accessed through scripts.

  - Node: Every single part of an HTML document, from the entire document to text, is
    considered an individual node.
      --Examples of Node Types: Event, Document, DocumentType, URL  

  - Root Node: The DOM is like a tree structure, as explained in the HTML. The highest
    order node is the root node. As a result, it is always the HTML document itself.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>	<!--The html element is a node and is a descendent of the root node.-->
	<head> <!--The head element is an element of the html element, and is also a node.-->
    <title>The title<!--This title statement is a node--></title>
	</head>
