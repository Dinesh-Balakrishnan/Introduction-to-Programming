/*
DEFINITIONS:

  - Specificity: The order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed.
    -- IDs are the most specific selector, followed by classes, then tags. The CSS properties of
       the more specific selector will override any similar CSS properties of the less specific selector.
    -- Chained selectors are more specific than their unchained counterparts.

*/

/*CSS can target elements by using their tag name (p, body, a, etc.) */
p { /*The targeted element is known as a selector. In this case, p is the selector. */

  /*To set the size of text from the default font size of 16px: */
  font-size: 18px;

  /* To set the font of text from the default typeface of Times New Roman: */
  font-family: "Garamond";
  /*NOTE: The font specified in the stylesheet must be installed on the user's computer. */
  /*NOTE: It is good practice to limit the number of typfaces used in a website to 3. */

  /*To change how bold or thin text appears: */
  font-weight: bold; /*Other properties: lighter, normal, bolder */

  /*To change how text aligns to a page: */
  text-align: right; /*Other properties: left, center, justify (Equal width)

  background-image: url("https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/130000/velka/multi-color-pattern-background.jpg");

}

/*Elements can also be targeted by their specified class by including '.' before the class name. */
.content { /*All elements with a class attribute of content will be selected. */
  color: maroon !important; /*Try not to use '!important'. Specificity raised to the max. */
}

/*Elements can even be targeted by their specified id by including '#' before the id name. */
#outline { /*The single element with an id attribute of outline will be selected. */

}

/*It is possible to chain selectors to target even more specific elements. */
h2.content { /* Only h2 headers with a class of content will be selected. */

}

/*It is also possible to target nested elements. */
#outline li { /* All list elements nested within the tag with the id "outline" will be selected. */
